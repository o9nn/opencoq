# OpenCoq FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: "How is it?"

**A: OpenCoq is in EXCELLENT condition! 🎉**

The project has successfully completed Phase 1 with a fully functional cognitive engine that includes:
- ✅ Complete hypergraph-based memory system
- ✅ Attention allocation and task scheduling
- ✅ Natural language processing interface
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation
- ✅ Extensive documentation

**Quick Status**: Run `./check_status.sh` for a detailed overview.

### Q: What has been implemented?

**A: A comprehensive cognitive engine with 5 core subsystems:**

1. **Memory System**: AtomSpace-inspired hypergraph store with Scheme integration
2. **Task System**: Priority-based cognitive operations scheduler
3. **Attention System**: Economic Attention Networks (ECAN) for resource allocation
4. **Reasoning Engine**: PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks) with forward/backward chaining
5. **Meta-Cognition**: Introspection, self-modification, and learning capabilities

### Q: How can I check the current status?

**A: Multiple ways to check status:**

- **Quick Check**: `./check_status.sh`
- **Detailed Report**: See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
