-- Z++ Specification for OpenCoq Tokenizer/Parser
-- Generated by Manus AI

-- The OpenCoq system utilizes a sophisticated parser for the Coq language, rather than a simple tokenizer.
-- This specification models the parsing process as a function that transforms a string of characters into a structured abstract syntax tree (AST).
-- The actual grammar and parsing logic are complex and defined in the OCaml code.

-- A simplified representation of the AST
AST ::= Node(type: STRING, children: seq AST) | Leaf(value: STRING)

-- The Parse operation
Parse
  input?: seq CHAR
  output!: AST
  error!: ℙ STRING
--
  -- The pre-condition is that the input string is available.
  pre input? ≠ ⟨⟩

  -- The post-condition is that either a valid AST is produced or a set of parsing errors is returned.
  post (output! ≠ ∅ ∧ error! = ∅) ∨ (output! = ∅ ∧ error! ≠ ∅)
