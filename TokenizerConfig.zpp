-- Z++ Specification for OpenCoq Tokenizer Configuration
-- Generated by Manus AI

-- This is a placeholder for the tokenizer configuration.
-- The OpenCoq system uses a sophisticated parser for the Coq language,
-- not a traditional tokenizer with a simple configuration.
-- The configuration is embedded within the grammar and parsing logic.

TokenizerConfig
  -- No explicit configurable parameters found in the repository.
  -- The behavior is determined by the compiled grammar and parser.
