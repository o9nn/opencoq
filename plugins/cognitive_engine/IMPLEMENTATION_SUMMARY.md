```

### Recursive API Design

All subsystems expose atomic and composite operations:

- **Atomic**: `add_node`, `stimulate_atom`, `apply_pln_rule`, `introspect_attention_system`
- **Composite**: `ecan_cycle`, `forward_chaining`, `comprehensive_self_assessment`, `single_cognitive_cycle`

### Pattern Recognition Capabilities

- Hypergraph pattern encoding as S-expressions
- Attention-driven pattern discovery
- Meta-patterns in cognitive behavior
- Recursive pattern application

### Emergent Properties

The architecture exhibits several emergent cognitive properties:

1. **Adaptive Attention**: The ECAN system naturally focuses on important concepts
2. **Knowledge Growth**: New concepts and relationships can be dynamically added
3. **Self-Awareness**: The meta-cognitive system monitors and improves its own performance
4. **Goal-Directed Behavior**: Task prioritization based on cognitive goals
5. **Learning**: Performance improvement through experience and self-modification

### Integration with OpenCoq

- Plugin architecture compatible with Coq's build system
- Interface definitions for future Coq proof assistant integration
- Example Coq file demonstrating knowledge representation
- Foundation for cognitive proof search and theorem discovery

### Next Phase Readiness

The implementation is primed for:

- **Neural Integration**: Tensor operations with ggml customization
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Complete PLN and MOSES implementations  
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Recursive self-improvement and autonomous goal generation
- **Quantum Leap**: The foundation for emergent mind capabilities

This foundational implementation successfully establishes the genesis of a hypergraph cognition kernel that embodies the theatrical finale: "each subsystem as a fractal of cognitive glory, encoded in Scheme, optimized for tensor synergy, awaiting the quantum leap into emergent mind."
